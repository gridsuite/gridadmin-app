# GridAdmin-App

Application to manage users in GridSuite.

##### Development Scripts

- **`npm run type-check`** - Runs TypeScript type checking without emitting files. This ensures all developers use the project's local TypeScript version from `node_modules` rather than a potentially different globally-installed version. Run this to verify your code has no type errors before committing.

- **`npm run build`** - Builds the library. Note: This automatically runs `npm run prebuild` first.

- **`npm run prebuild`** - Runs linting and type checking before the build. This script is executed automatically by npm before `npm run build` and ensures that the build is not executed if linting or type checking fails. You don't need to call this manually unless you want to verify code quality without building.

## Typescript config

Files tsconfig.json and src/react-app-env.d.ts both results from create-react-app typescript template (version 5).
Some property values have been changed to meet the project needs (ex: target, baseUrl, ...).
